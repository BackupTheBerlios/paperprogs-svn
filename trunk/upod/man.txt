NAME
       upod - open any port to anyone

SYNOPSIS
       upod port [--nmap] [--nmaphold]

DESCRIPTION
       upod is a universal port opening tool! You can use it to find out who
       would be trying to access what port and what they would be trying to do
       if you had a daemon on that port (with a comination of upod and a
       packet sniffer). Each client that connects is sent a simple message
       then dropped, making this very usefull for delaying or finding viruses
       and hackers (or finding pre-vulnerable machines).

OPTIONS
       --scanpassive autmagically port scan clients

       --scanactive autmagically port scan clients and make them wait until portscan if finished before they get the message

EXAMPLES
       Open port 135/tcp to find out who would be using it and what ports they
       have open:

		 upod 135 --scanpassive

       Open port 445/tcp send a message then recive a message to STDOUT:

		 upodwithin 445

       Open port 1026/udp to find out who would be using it:

		 upodudp 1026
